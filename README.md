# workTracker
those scripts allows you to get events from a google calendar where events are created in this way:
- event title: client
- event description: what have you done

then I'll catch them and I'll create 3 different files:
1. a cvs spreadsheet
2. a markdown (pdf exportable) file with your descriptions
3. a latex file for the invoces

## database
I actually use a sqlite pillow database, just for organization
TODO: I could use redis (ram only database)

## spreadsheet
- description

## markdown
- description

## latex
- description
