# calendarToFiles
calendar to Files allow you to get events from a work calendar where events are created in this way:
- event title: 
- event description:
- event durate:

then I'll catch them and I'll create 2 different files:
1. and ods/cvs spreadsheet
2. a markdown (pdf exportable) file

## calendar
## spreadsheet
